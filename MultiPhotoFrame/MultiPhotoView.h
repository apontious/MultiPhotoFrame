 Abstract: The class is responsible for the layout of photos and acts as the dragging source and dragging destination of this application.
 Dragging: Dragging can accept 1-4 image files. Add a Finder comment via Get Info for the label. You can drag 1 photo from the window to create
 a new window.
 
 Layout: This view is made up of Photo Cell Views which are laid out automatically. The Cell Views are loaded from a nib file via PhotoCellViewControllers. Since this demo focuses on dragging, layout is done manually on up to 4 image files. If you drop more images to exceed a total of 4, the currently shown images will fade away during the drop animation.
