     File: MultiPhotoView.m 
 Abstract: The class is responsible for the layout of photos and acts as the dragging source and dragging destination of this application.
 Dragging: Dragging can accept 1-4 image files. Add a Finder comment via Get Info for the label. You can drag 1 photo from the window to create
 a new window.
 
 Layout: This view is made up of Photo Cell Views which are laid out automatically. The Cell Views are loaded from a nib file via PhotoCellViewControllers. Since this demo focuses on dragging, layout is done manually on up to 4 image files. If you drop more images to exceed a total of 4, the currently shown images will fade away during the drop animation.

/* This method takes an array of PhtoCellViewControllers and returns a map table containing the suggested layout frames of each cell view. The are two reasons for returning a suggestion table instead of setting the frame of each cell view directly. First, the input array of controllers may contain existing cell views along with new ones for the drag images. We don't want to modify existing cell views when we setup the ones for dragging but, we need the complete set of controllers to properly determine the layout. Second, on drop, we want to animate the frame change.
 
    We try to tastefully layout up to 4 images taking into consideration the orientation of the photos. The orientation really only matters for 2 up and 3 up collections. For 2 up, show two portrait panels side-by-side or two Landscape panels stacked. For 3 up, show 1 portrait with two landscapes stacked to the right, or 1 landscape with two side-by-side portraits underneath.

#pragma mark - Dragging Destination Methods

/* As a drag destination, this view accepts 1-4 local file URLS at a time. If the addition of the dropped files results in a total of 4 or less photo in the view, then the dragged photos are added to current ones. However, if the drop would result in more than 4 photos, the currently shows photos are removed and we retain just the dropped photos. This demonstrates two animation done inside this view during the drop animation performed by the OS.
 
   Note 1: You can have more than just photos in the drag, but only the photos (up to 4 of them) are accepted. When you do this, notice that the non photo file drag items dissapear and the cursor badge count changes. If you drag back over the Finder, they return.
 
   Note 2: The comment string displayed under the pictures comes from the Finder's comment field of the file. You can change this via the Finder's Get Info panel.
